export const SITE_HELP = `# Loki site authoring guide

You are authoring a server-rendered (SSR) Preact site. The code lives in D1 as a
draft working tree; you edit it with the site_* MCP tools, preview it, then
publish an immutable version. Content comes from the CMS via GraphQL.

## Files & conventions

- File-based routing under \`routes/\`:
  - \`routes/index.tsx\`        -> \`/\`
  - \`routes/about.tsx\`        -> \`/about\`
  - \`routes/posts/index.tsx\`  -> \`/posts\`
  - \`routes/posts/[slug].tsx\` -> \`/posts/:slug\` (the \`slug\` becomes a route param)
- \`styles.css\` (top-level) is served at \`/styles.css\` and auto-linked into every page.
- \`main.ts\` (or main.tsx/js) is an ESCAPE HATCH: if present it must default-export
  a fetch handler \`{ fetch(request, env, ctx) }\` and it fully replaces file routing.
- \`*.graphql\` files are treated as standalone GraphQL documents (validated at publish).

## Route module shape

Each route module default-exports a Preact component. Optionally export:
- \`loader({ env, params, request })\` -> returns props (may be async; runs on the server).
- \`head\` -> an object \`{ title, meta: [...], links: [{rel, href}] }\`, or a
  function \`(props) => head\`. Each \`meta\` item is EITHER \`{ name, content }\`
  (standard meta) OR \`{ property, content }\` (Open-Graph / Facebook — e.g.
  \`{ property: "og:image", content: "/og.png" }\`). A meta given as
  \`{ name: "og:..." }\` (or \`fb:\`/\`article:\`) is auto-mapped to \`property\` for you.

### Global head (site-wide favicon / OG / meta)

Set a favicon, default OG tags, or any site-wide \`<head>\` bits ONCE by exporting
\`head\` from a top-level \`app.tsx\` (or app.ts/js). It has the SAME shape as a route
head (object or \`(props) => head\`) and is merged UNDER every page:

- \`title\`: the route's wins if it sets one, else the global title.
- \`meta\` / \`links\`: unioned. A route entry OVERRIDES a global one with the same
  identity — meta by its \`name\`/\`property\`, links by \`rel\`+\`href\` — and duplicates
  are collapsed, so you never emit two favicons or two \`og:image\` tags.

    // app.tsx — applies to every route
    export const head = {
      links: [{ rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
      meta: [
        { property: "og:image", content: "/og.png" },
        { property: "og:site_name", content: "My Site" },
      ],
    };

A route that sets its own \`head\` still works: it keeps the global favicon while
overriding \`title\` and any tag it re-declares (e.g. a page-specific \`og:image\`).
- \`action({ request, env, params })\` -> handles NON-GET requests to this route
  (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) — see "Route actions" below.

The component receives \`{ ...loaderProps, params }\`.

## Route actions (form handling & writes)

A non-GET request to a route is dispatched to that route's \`action\` export
(instead of rendering the component). If the matched route has no \`action\`, the
response is \`405 Method Not Allowed\`. Action return values are normalized:

- a \`Response\` (including \`Response.redirect(url, 303)\`) -> passed through as-is;
- a \`{ redirect: "/path" }\` sentinel -> \`303 See Other\` to that path (use this
  for the post/redirect/get pattern after a successful form POST);
- \`null\`/\`undefined\` -> \`204 No Content\`;
- any other plain value -> \`200\` JSON response.

    // routes/contact.tsx
    export async function action({ request, env }) {
      const form = await request.formData();
      const email = String(form.get("email") || "");
      if (!email.includes("@")) return new Response("Bad email", { status: 400 });
      // ...do the write...
      return { redirect: "/contact?sent=1" }; // 303 back to the page
    }
    export default function Contact({ params }) {
      return (
        <form method="post">
          <input name="email" type="email" required />
          <button>Sign up</button>
        </form>
      );
    }

## Server functions: serverFn (the PREFERRED path for forms / mutations / data)

A \`serverFn\` is a typed, validated server function. It is the recommended way to
do mutations and typed reads — reach for a raw route \`action\` only when you need a
full \`Response\` (redirects, non-JSON, webhooks). Define it in its own module and
import it from BOTH a loader (server) and an island (browser):

    // functions/guestbook.ts
    import { serverFn } from "loki/runtime";
    import type { GuestbookEntryRecord } from "loki/schema";

    export const createEntry = serverFn({ method: "POST" })
      .validator((input) => ({
        name: String(input.name).slice(0, 80),
        message: String(input.message).slice(0, 500),
      }))
      .handler(async ({ data, env }): Promise<{ id: string }> => {
        const created = await env.RECORDS.create("guestbook_entry", data);
        if (created.error) throw new Error(created.error);
        await env.REALTIME.publish("guestbook", { id: created.id, ...data });
        return { id: created.id };
      });

    export const recentEntries = serverFn() // method defaults to GET (a read)
      .handler(async ({ env }): Promise<GuestbookEntryRecord[]> => {
        const data = await query(env, ENTRIES);
        return data.allGuestbookEntries;
      });

- \`.validator(fn)\`: transforms/validates the RAW input into the typed \`data\` your
  handler receives. If it throws, the RPC call returns \`400\` with the thrown
  message. Optional (defaults to identity). Its return TYPE is your \`data\` type.
- \`.handler({ data, env, request })\`: runs IN THE ISOLATE. \`env\` is the site's
  narrow capability env — the SAME one a loader/render gets: \`env.GRAPHQL\`,
  \`env.RECORDS\`, \`env.REALTIME\`. There is NO raw DB, NO loader, NO outbound fetch.
  The return value is JSON-serialized to callers; annotate it (e.g. via
  \`import type { X } from "loki/schema"\`) so its type flows to the caller.
- \`method\`: \`"GET"\` (default, for reads) or \`"POST"\` (mutations).

### Two ways to call the SAME imported function

- FROM A LOADER (server-side): just call it — a direct in-isolate call, no HTTP.
  \`env\` is supplied for you (do NOT pass it):

      // routes/guestbook.tsx
      import { recentEntries } from "../functions/guestbook.ts";
      export async function loader() {
        return { entries: await recentEntries() };
      }

- FROM AN ISLAND (browser): the SAME import becomes an RPC stub. Calling it does
  \`POST /__fn/<version>/<id>\` (or \`/__fn/draft/...\` in preview) with \`{ data }\` and
  returns the parsed result — no full-page reload:

      // components/guestbook.tsx (island)
      import { createEntry } from "../functions/guestbook.ts";
      // ...inside a submit handler:
      const { id } = await createEntry({ name, message });

  This dual behaviour is automatic: the module resolves to the real handler in the
  isolate and to a fetch stub in the browser (like how \`query()\` is server-only).
  Each serverFn has a stable id derived from its module path + export name, so warm
  isolates cache across publishes of unchanged code. serverFns must be NAMED
  exports and require file-based routing (not the \`main.*\` escape hatch).

### Security (READ THIS)

A serverFn runs SANDBOXED in the site isolate with EXACTLY the capabilities a
route loader has — \`env.GRAPHQL\` (read), \`env.RECORDS.create\` (gated by
loki.config.json \`writableModels\`), \`env.REALTIME.publish\` — and nothing else. It
cannot reach D1, the Worker Loader, or the network directly, and \`env.RECORDS\`
rejects any model not in your allowlist exactly as it does from a loader. Writing
a serverFn does NOT escalate privileges beyond what your page code already has.

## Scoped record writes: env.RECORDS.create

Route actions (and loaders) can create CMS records via \`env.RECORDS\`, but ONLY
for models the site explicitly opts into. List those model api_keys in a
top-level \`loki.config.json\`:

    { "writableModels": ["guestbook_entry"] }

At publish, this file must be valid JSON and every listed model must exist, or
the publish fails. The published tree's allowlist is snapshotted with the version
(the draft's config applies in preview).

\`await env.RECORDS.create(modelApiKey, fields)\`:
- rejects models not in the allowlist -> resolves to \`{ error: "..." }\`;
- creates the record via the CMS; if the model has drafts enabled it is
  immediately PUBLISHED so published GraphQL queries see it;
- returns \`{ id }\` on success, or \`{ error }\` (CMS validation failures — e.g. a
  required field missing or a validator tripped — pass through in \`error\`).

RECORDS exposes ONLY \`create\` (no update/delete/query). There is NO rate limiting
in v1: a public write route MUST validate inputs itself and rely on model field
validators (length caps, required, format) to reject junk.

## Realtime: env.REALTIME.publish (server) + connectChannel (client)

Push live updates to connected browsers over WebSockets.

- Server (action/loader): \`await env.REALTIME.publish(channel, message)\` —
  \`channel\` is any string, \`message\` must be JSON-serializable. It fans out to
  every browser subscribed to that channel. No history: a client that connects
  after a publish does not receive it.
- Client (inside an island only): \`connectChannel(name, onMessage)\` from
  \`loki/runtime\` opens a WebSocket to that channel (wss on https), JSON-parses
  each message into \`onMessage\`, auto-reconnects with capped backoff, and returns
  \`{ close }\` for cleanup. It THROWS if called during SSR — call it in a
  \`useEffect\`.

## Imports available

- \`preact\`, \`preact/hooks\`, \`preact/jsx-runtime\` (JSX is auto-configured for preact).
- \`preact-render-to-string\` (rendering is handled for you; rarely needed directly).
- \`loki/runtime\` -> \`gql\` (tag GraphQL documents), \`query(env, document, variables)\`
  (runs a GraphQL query against the CMS; drafts are visible in preview mode),
  \`renderStructuredText(value)\` (renders a Structured Text DAST value to Preact vnodes),
  \`Island\` (the client-hydration helper — see "Islands" below),
  \`serverFn({...}).validator(...).handler(...)\` (a typed, validated server function
  callable from a loader OR a browser island — see "Server functions" below), and
  \`connectChannel(name, onMessage)\` (client-only realtime subscription — see
  "Realtime" below).
- \`loki/schema\` (TYPE IMPORTS ONLY) -> content types generated from the live
  schema: \`import type { BlogPostRecord, Query } from "loki/schema"\`. See "Typed
  content" below; read the exact shapes with the \`schema_types\` tool.
- Relative imports between your own files must include the extension, e.g.
  \`import { Layout } from "./components/layout.tsx"\`.

Do NOT rely on network access, \`process\`, or Node built-ins — the site runs in an
isolated worker with no outbound fetch except the GraphQL binding.

## Typed content (schema_types + loki/schema)

Your content has a real, live-generated TypeScript type for every model. Use it —
you have no IDE hover, so reading the types is how you know the exact field names
and shapes you're coding against.

1. Run the \`schema_types\` MCP tool FIRST. It returns TypeScript generated from the
   LIVE schema: one interface per record type (e.g. \`BlogPostRecord\`,
   \`GuestbookEntryRecord\`), the \`Query\` root (\`allBlogPosts\` / \`blogPost\` /
   \`_allBlogPostsMeta\` return shapes, each field's args in a JSDoc comment), the
   \`*OrderBy\` and \`ItemStatus\` enums, and the filter input types. Nullability
   (\`| null\`), lists (\`T[]\`), nested linked records, and Structured Text
   (\`{ value, blocks, inlineBlocks, links }\`) are all rendered faithfully.
2. Annotate loaders and props with \`import type\` from \`loki/schema\` — the SAME
   types:

       import type { BlogPostRecord, Query } from "loki/schema";
       export async function loader({ env }): Promise<{ posts: BlogPostRecord[] }> { … }
       export default function Home({ posts }: { posts: BlogPostRecord[] }) { … }

   \`loki/schema\` is TYPES-ONLY: \`import type\` (and any import used only in type
   positions) is erased at transpile, so it adds NO runtime import. Using one of
   its names as a runtime VALUE fails the write with a clear message — keep it to
   \`import type\`.
3. Every \`gql\`\`...\`\`\` document is validated against the live schema at WRITE time:
   \`site_write\` returns a \`graphqlErrors\` block (precise messages, e.g.
   \`Cannot query field "x" on type "BlogPostRecord". Did you mean "y"?\`) the moment
   you save. Those errors are NON-FATAL (the file is still written, so you can
   scaffold a component before its query is done) — but \`publish_site\` HARD-GATES
   on the same validation, so fix them before publishing.

## Example: routes/posts/[slug].tsx

The CMS schema is DatoCMS-style: singular record fields take a \`filter\`, and
Structured Text fields expose \`{ value, blocks, inlineBlocks, links }\` — there is
NO pre-rendered \`bodyHtml\`. Query \`body { value }\` (the DAST JSON) and render it
with \`renderStructuredText\`. (Explore the exact fields first with the
\`graphql_query\` MCP tool — introspection is allowed.)

    import { gql, query, renderStructuredText } from "loki/runtime";
    import type { BlogPostRecord } from "loki/schema";

    const POST = gql\`
      query Post($slug: String!) {
        blogPost(filter: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
          title
          body {
            value
          }
        }
      }
    \`;

    // Type the loader's return so props are checked against the real schema.
    export async function loader({ env, params }): Promise<{ post: BlogPostRecord | null }> {
      const data = await query(env, POST, { slug: params.slug });
      return { post: data.blogPost };
    }

    export const head = (props: { post: BlogPostRecord | null }) =>
      ({ title: props.post?.title ?? "Post" });

    export default function Post({ post }: { post: BlogPostRecord | null }) {
      if (!post) return <main><h1>Not found</h1></main>;
      return (
        <main class="post">
          <h1>{post.title}</h1>
          <div class="body">{renderStructuredText(post.body?.value)}</div>
        </main>
      );
    }

    // \`BlogPostRecord\` (and Query, filter/orderBy types) come from the live schema —
    // run \`schema_types\` to read the exact fields. \`import type\` is erased at
    // transpile, so it adds no runtime import.

## Islands (client-side interactivity)

The site is SSR by default — server components + a route \`loader\` are the RIGHT
tool for almost everything (data fetching, layout, content). Reach for an island
ONLY when a piece of UI needs to run in the browser (local state, event handlers,
timers). Everything else should stay server-rendered.

An island is a normal component file (e.g. \`components/counter.tsx\`) that you drop
into a page with the \`Island\` helper. It is server-rendered for first paint AND
hydrated in the browser, so \`useState\`/\`useEffect\`/\`useRef\` (from \`preact/hooks\`)
and event handlers work. The SAME file is imported server-side (for SSR) and
served to the browser (for hydration) — no separate client bundle.

    // components/counter.tsx
    import { useState } from "preact/hooks";
    export default function Counter({ initial = 0 }) {
      const [n, setN] = useState(initial);
      return (
        <div class="counter">
          <button onClick={() => setN(n - 1)}>-</button>
          <output>{n}</output>
          <button onClick={() => setN(n + 1)}>+</button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    // routes/index.tsx
    import { Island } from "loki/runtime";
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <main>
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <Island src="components/counter.tsx" client="load" initial={5} />
        </main>
      );
    }

\`Island\` props:
- \`src\` (required) — path of the component file in the site tree, e.g.
  \`"components/counter.tsx"\` (extension recommended).
- \`client\` — WHEN to hydrate: \`"load"\` (default, immediately), \`"idle"\`
  (requestIdleCallback), or \`"visible"\` (on first scroll into view). Prefer
  \`idle\`/\`visible\` for below-the-fold widgets.
- everything else is passed to the component as props. Props MUST be
  JSON-serializable (strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, plain objects) —
  they are serialized at SSR and re-parsed to hydrate. Passing a function or
  BigInt throws a clear error at render time. Islands do not receive children.

Rules & notes:
- Data is a SERVER concern: call \`query()\` in a route \`loader\` and pass the
  result into the island as props. \`query()\` is server-only and THROWS in the
  browser. Islands must not fetch from the CMS directly.
- Loki injects an import map + a tiny hydration script into the page \`<head>\`
  automatically, only when a page actually uses an island.
- Islands require file-based routing (they don't work under a \`main.*\` escape
  hatch).

## Worked example: live guestbook (serverFn + RECORDS + REALTIME + island)

The canonical pattern. A shared \`functions/\` module defines a typed POST serverFn
(validate -> create record -> publish to a channel); the route loader reads via a
GET serverFn; the form island calls the POST serverFn on submit (RPC — no reload)
and subscribes to the channel to append everyone's entries live.

    // loki.config.json
    { "writableModels": ["guestbook_entry"] }

    // functions/guestbook.ts — shared by the loader (server) and island (browser)
    import { gql, query, serverFn } from "loki/runtime";
    import type { GuestbookEntryRecord } from "loki/schema";

    const ENTRIES = gql\`
      query { allGuestbookEntries(orderBy: _createdAt_DESC, first: 50) { id name message } }
    \`;

    export const recentEntries = serverFn()
      .handler(async ({ env }): Promise<GuestbookEntryRecord[]> => {
        const data = await query(env, ENTRIES);
        return data.allGuestbookEntries;
      });

    export const createEntry = serverFn({ method: "POST" })
      .validator((input) => {
        const name = String(input.name || "").trim().slice(0, 80);
        const message = String(input.message || "").trim().slice(0, 500);
        if (!name || !message) throw new Error("name and message are required");
        return { name, message };
      })
      .handler(async ({ data, env }): Promise<{ id: string } & typeof data> => {
        const created = await env.RECORDS.create("guestbook_entry", data);
        if (created.error) throw new Error(created.error);
        await env.REALTIME.publish("guestbook", { id: created.id, ...data });
        return { id: created.id, ...data };
      });

    // routes/guestbook.tsx — loader calls the GET serverFn DIRECTLY (in-isolate)
    import { Island } from "loki/runtime";
    import { recentEntries } from "../functions/guestbook.ts";
    export async function loader() {
      return { entries: await recentEntries() };
    }
    export default function Guestbook({ entries }) {
      return <Island src="components/guestbook.tsx" client="load" entries={entries} />;
    }

    // components/guestbook.tsx — island: calls the POST serverFn over RPC on submit
    import { useState, useEffect } from "preact/hooks";
    import { connectChannel } from "loki/runtime";
    import { createEntry } from "../functions/guestbook.ts";
    export default function Guestbook({ entries }) {
      const [items, setItems] = useState(entries || []);
      useEffect(() => {
        const ch = connectChannel("guestbook", (e) => setItems((cur) => [e, ...cur]));
        return () => ch.close();
      }, []);
      async function onSubmit(ev) {
        ev.preventDefault();
        const f = ev.currentTarget;
        try {
          // RPC to the isolate; the channel echo appends it for us.
          await createEntry({ name: f.name.value, message: f.message.value });
          f.reset();
        } catch (err) { alert(String(err.message || err)); }
      }
      return (
        <section>
          <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
            <input name="name" required maxLength={80} />
            <input name="message" required maxLength={500} />
            <button>Sign</button>
          </form>
          <ul>{items.map((e) => <li key={e.id}><b>{e.name}</b>: {e.message}</li>)}</ul>
        </section>
      );
    }

The poster's own submit updates the list via the channel echo (no reload); OTHER
open browsers get it live over the same channel. \`createEntry\` runs the SAME
validated handler whether reached from a loader or this island — the browser build
just turns the call into an RPC. (A raw route \`action\` still works as the escape
hatch when you need a redirect or a non-JSON \`Response\`.)

## styles.css example

    body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; max-width: 42rem; margin: 2rem auto; }

## Assets (favicons, images, fonts, downloads) — "it's just a file"

Static/design files live under \`public/\` and serve at the site ROOT. There is
exactly ONE rule:

    public/favicon.ico      ->  /favicon.ico
    public/img/hero.jpg     ->  /img/hero.jpg
    public/files/brochure.pdf -> /files/brochure.pdf

Two tools mirror site_write; BOTH require a \`public/…\` path and BOTH return JSON
\`{ path, url, hash, size, contentType }\` where **\`url\` is the exact string to
paste into markup/CSS** (already root-mapped — do NOT prefix it with \`public/\`):

- \`site_asset_import({ path, url })\` — Loki fetches the URL (it has network
  access; your site worker does not) and stores the bytes. Use for anything but
  tiny files (photos, og-images, downloads).
- \`site_asset_write({ path, base64, contentType? })\` — decode base64 bytes.
  For SMALL files only (favicon, inline SVG); ~2 MB cap, over which it errors and
  tells you to use site_asset_import. \`contentType\` is inferred from the
  extension if omitted (common web/text/font types are known, incl. \`.svg\`,
  \`.json\`, \`.md\`, \`.txt\`, \`.csv\`, \`.xml\`, \`.webmanifest\`, \`.woff2\`). If the
  extension is unknown the result carries \`contentTypeInferred: false\` + a \`note\`
  — pass an explicit \`contentType\` in that case.

Assets are DRAFT until you publish, and they version / preview / rollback exactly
like code: preview shows the draft manifest (no-store), the published site serves
the version's snapshot (ETag = content hash, \`Cache-Control: public, max-age=300,
must-revalidate\`), and rollback_site restores that version's asset set (a rollback
to before an asset was added makes it 404 — assets are version-pinned).

RESERVED — a \`public/\` path whose root URL is one of these is rejected (Loki/CMS
own them): /mcp, /graphql, /api/*, /assets/*, /uploads/*, /health, /paths/*,
/openapi.json, and /__* (/__vendor, /__modules, /__preview, /__realtime).
(\`/assets/*\` and \`/uploads/*\` are the CMS *content* asset routes — different from
these site files.)

### Worked example: favicon + og-image + CSS hero + a download

    // 1) favicon — tiny, so write it inline as base64 (or import a URL):
    site_asset_write({
      path: "public/favicon.ico",
      base64: "<base64 bytes>",           // data: URL prefix is tolerated
    })
    // -> { "url": "/favicon.ico", "hash": "…", "size": 1150, "contentType": "image/x-icon" }

    // 2) og-image — import a real image by URL:
    site_asset_import({ path: "public/og.png", url: "https://example.com/og.png" })
    // -> { "url": "/og.png", … }

    // 3) hero photo used from CSS:
    site_asset_import({ path: "public/img/hero.jpg", url: "https://example.com/hero.jpg" })
    // -> { "url": "/img/hero.jpg", … }

    // 4) a downloadable PDF:
    site_asset_import({ path: "public/files/brochure.pdf", url: "https://example.com/brochure.pdf" })
    // -> { "url": "/files/brochure.pdf", … }

Reference the returned \`url\` strings verbatim. Set the favicon + a default
og-image ONCE in \`app.tsx\` (global head) so every route inherits them:

    // app.tsx — site-wide head (favicon + default OG), merged under every page
    export const head = {
      links: [{ rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
      meta: [{ property: "og:image", content: "/og.png" }],
    };

A route only needs a \`head\` to override — e.g. its own title or og:image:

    // routes/index.tsx — favicon + default og:image come from app.tsx
    export const head = {
      title: "Home",
      // meta: [{ property: "og:image", content: "/og-home.png" }], // page override
    };
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <main class="hero">
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <a href="/files/brochure.pdf" download>Download the brochure (PDF)</a>
        </main>
      );
    }

    /* styles.css — hero background from the imported image */
    .hero { background: url(/img/hero.jpg) center / cover no-repeat; min-height: 60vh; }

Then \`publish_site\` — it snapshots the asset manifest into the version and warns
(non-fatal) about any \`/foo.ext\` reference in your code that has no matching
\`public/foo.ext\` asset. \`site_list\` shows assets alongside code; \`site_read\` on a
\`public/…\` path returns metadata (not bytes); \`site_delete\` removes an asset;
\`site_diff\` shows added/changed/removed assets (compared by content hash).

## GraphQL notes

- Prototype queries with the \`graphql_query\` MCP tool before wiring them into a
  route: \`graphql_query({ query, variables?, includeDrafts? })\` runs against the
  live schema and returns \`{ data, errors }\`. Introspection is allowed, so you can
  discover the exact model and field names first.
- Naming is DatoCMS-style: collections are pluralised (\`allBlogPosts\`), single
  records are singular with a \`filter\` (\`blogPost(filter: { slug: { eq: $slug } })\`),
  and record types are \`...Record\` (\`BlogPostRecord\`). Structured Text fields expose
  \`{ value, blocks, inlineBlocks, links }\`; render \`value\` with \`renderStructuredText\`.
- Tag every query with \`gql\` (or put it in a \`.graphql\` file). At publish, ALL
  documents are validated against the live CMS schema — unknown fields/types fail
  the publish with per-document errors.
- Keep gql documents self-contained: \`\${...}\` interpolations are stripped before
  validation, so inline fragments/variables rather than interpolating query text.
- The published version records a "footprint" of the (Type.field) pairs it uses.
  This powers the migration guard: deleting a field/model the live site depends on
  is rejected. The safe schema-change order is:
  expand (add new field) -> backfill content -> publish the site using it ->
  contract (remove the old field).

## Workflow

0. schema_types()                          -> read the content types before querying
1. site_write("routes/index.tsx", "...")   (transpiled + gql validated; errors returned)
2. preview_site()                          -> open the returned URL to see the DRAFT
3. publish_site("message")                 -> validates + smoke-renders + snapshots
4. rollback_site(versionId) / site_versions() as needed

## Previewing without a browser

\`preview_site\` returns a \`/__preview?token=...\` URL. It sets an HttpOnly cookie
named \`loki_preview\` (Path=/, Max-Age=1800, SameSite=Lax) and 302-redirects to /.
For non-browser clients use a cookie jar:

    curl -sc jar "<preview_url>" -o /dev/null      # step 1: capture loki_preview cookie
    curl -sb jar "<origin>/posts/my-post"          # step 2: draft HTML, reusing the jar

The token is valid for 30 minutes and is tied to that window, NOT to the draft
contents. After further site_write edits, DO NOT mint a new token — just re-request
the path with the same jar; the draft tree is rebuilt on every request. Only call
preview_site again once the 30-minute token has expired.

Other tools: graphql_query({query, variables?, includeDrafts?}) (explore the content
API / introspection), site_read(path), site_list(), site_delete(path), site_diff()
(shows added/removed/changed paths vs the published version), and the asset tools
site_asset_import({path, url}) / site_asset_write({path, base64, contentType?}) —
see the "Assets" section above.`;
